<h2>Test Harness Bot for PGO</h2>

Extremely easy to use fully featured bot which will play the game for you when you cannot. Harvest pokestops, collect pokemon, transfer, evolve, all automatically. <a href="https://github.com/disdain13/PokeRoadie/wiki" title="goto the WIKI, just do it!">Checkout the full list of new features in our WIKI</a><br/><br/>

###In the beginning, There was a game which many felt the need to pillage in a programmatic fashion.###

*[FeroxRev](https://github.com/FeroxRev/Pokemon-Go-Rocket-API)*
 wrote the .Net wrapper for talking to the PokemonGo servers. This included generation of classes which represented the data, and the foundation for communicating using them. PokeRoadie uses a 99% pure FeroxRev API implementation, so he is responsible for quite a bit of the code.

*[Necronomicon](https://github.com/NecronomiconCoding/NecroBot)*
 picked up the API and built his bot, and led the development of many features still found in PokeRoadie today. The first walking, harvesting, transfer, evolution code was thanks to him. In many ways, this is some of the toughest code, because it was a discovery process, and there was no expert on the subject. He just had to become one.

*[DetectiveSquirrel](https://github.com/DetectiveSquirrel/)*
 was responsible for the console coloring which is still in place today!

*[Spegeli](https://github.com/Spegeli/PokemoGoBot-GottaCatchEmAll/)*
 forked Necronomicon's bot, and put in work to add new features. He started digging into configuration possibilities, and advanced logic. PokieRoadie was forked from his bot, and it is nice to start with a well done piece of code.

That's Me! <a href="https://www.reverbnation.com/disdainrap" title="go ahead, you know you want to...">I am a rapper...</a> but, I program a little too. I just found this fun, and decided to help out by throwing in my 2 cents. I forked it, but it will never be done.

**I Like What I'm Seeing!**<br/>
There is no denying science, and that is the reason the <i>True Value</i> calculation works. Need proof? It has organically grown this inventory over 1 week, evolved them, and transferred ones it deemed unfit based on <i>True Value</i>. It seems to be bubbling up some pretty nice stuff.<br/><br/>
